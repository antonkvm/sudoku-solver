# Sudoku solver

Solve a given Sudoku puzzle using backtracking and heuristics. I made this as a little personal challenge and because I play Sudoku on my phone a lot.

## Usage

~~~Python
from sudoku import SudokuGrid
import puzzles

# define a puzzle input:
grid_1 = [
    [0, 0, 0, 2, 6, 0, 7, 0, 1],
    [6, 8, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 9, 0],
    [1, 9, 0, 0, 0, 4, 5, 0, 0],
    [8, 2, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0],
    [0, 0, 4, 6, 0, 2, 9, 0, 0],
    [0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 2, 8],
    [0, 0, 9, 3, 0, 0, 0, 7, 4],
    [0, 4, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 3, 6],
    [7, 0, 3, 0, 1, 8, 0, 0, 0],
]

# or choose a predefined one:
grid_2 = puzzles.NOTFUN

# create a new SudokuGrid object from the puzzle input:
puzzle = SudokuGrid(grid_1)

# show unsolved puzzle:
print(puzzle)

# solve it:
puzzle.solve()

# show solved puzzle:
print(puzzle)
~~~

## Implemented Heuristics

Currently these heuristics are implemented:

- Simple row, column, and 3x3 subgrid inconsistency check:
  - not much of a heuristic but whatever.
- Minumum Remaining Values (MRV):
  - prefer trying a value for the cell with the fewest remaining candidates (i.e. most constrained)
  - a smaller candidate set to choose from reduces the chance of picking a wrong value
- Constraint Propagation:
  - entering a value into a cell removes that value from the candidate sets of connected cells
  - boosts effectiveness of MRV because we continuously reduce the size of candidate sets
- Look-Ahead Candidate Selection:
  - skip a candidate if choosing it would mean another cell has no valid canidate left through constraint propagation
  - effecting an empty candidate set means that backtracking branch is hopeless, so we can prune it
- Least Constraining Value (LCV)
  - prefer the candidate for a cell that impacts the fewest other candidate sets
  - reduces the chance of eliminating a correct candidate

## Performance

The app currently solves these puzzles (from `puzzles.py`) with this performace:

- easy1: 45 steps for 45 empty cells
- easy2: 45 steps for 45 empty cells
- intermediate: 834 steps for 57 empty cells
- difficult1: 2279 steps for 58 empty cells
- difficult2: 76 steps for 47 empty cells
- notfun: 3330 steps for 62 empty cells
- skiena_hard: 8522 steps for 64 empty cells

> A step is defined as entering a value into a cell and then moving on to the next cell.

## Heuristic trade-off

The performance generally improved when I added new heuristics and optimizations, but interestingly, adding the Least Constraining Value (LCV) Heuristic resulted in both better and worse performace, depending on the input puzzle. This shows that implementing a new heuristic is not a guaranteed improvement for every input, but rather just increases the chance of improvement.

| Optimization                | intermediate | difficult2 | notfun | skiena_hard |
|-----------------------------|:------------:|:----------:|:------:|:-----------:|
| Before adding LCV heuristic |      384     |     113    |  1230  |    27211    |
| After adding LCV heuristic  |      834     |     76     |  3330  |     8522    |
