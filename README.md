# Sudoku solver

This application solves a given Sudoku puzzle using backtracking.

## Implemented Heuristics

Currently the app implements the following heuristics:

- simple row, column, and 3x3 subgrid inconsistency check
- Minumum Remaining Values (MRV):
  - prefer the cells with the fewest remaining candidates (i.e. the most constrained cells), reducing the chance of picking a wrong value
- Constraint Propagation:
  - entering a value into a cell removes that value from the candidate sets of connected cells
  - boosts effectiveness of MRV
- Look-Ahead Candidate Selection:
  - skip a candidate for a cell if choosing that value would cause another cell to have an empty candidate set through constraint propagation
  - that candidate is hopeless because eventually, we would encounter that other candidateless cell and would have to backtrack
- Least Constraining Value (LCV)
  - prefer the candidate for a cell that impacts the fewest candidate sets of other connected cells through constraint propagation, reducing the chance of eliminating a correct candidate

## Performance

The app currently solves these puzzles (from `puzzles.py`) with this performace:

- easy1: 45 steps for 45 empty cells
- easy2: 45 steps for 45 empty cells
- intermediate: 834 steps for 57 empty cells 
- difficult1: 2279 steps for 58 empty cells
- difficult2: 76 steps for 47 empty cells
- notfun: 3330 steps for 62 empty cells
- skiena_hard: 8522 for 64 empty cells

> A step is defined as entering a value into a cell and then moving on to the next cell.

Notice that for the easy puzzles, the algorithm never made a single wrong choice for a cell and never had to backtrack.

## Optimization anomaly

The performance generally improved when I added new heuristics and optimizations, but interestingly, adding the Least Constraining Value Heuristic resulted in both better and worse performace, depending on the input puzzle.

| Optimization                | intermediate | difficult2 | notfun | skiena_hard |
|-----------------------------|:------------:|:----------:|:------:|:-----------:|
| Before adding LCV heuristic |      384     |     113    |  1230  |    27211    |
| After adding LCV heuristic  |      834     |     76     |  3330  |     8522    |

## Next steps

The next improvements that make sense to implement are for instance:

 - Various techniques one might use when solving a sudoku puzzle manually, like cover elimination or pointing pairs. These could help eliminate candidates and shave off a few steps.
 - maybe do something "fun" like add a front end and a website
